### Hi I'm Lean Tavares ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 28-year-old man from Brasilia who is passionate about technology and innovation. At the age of 19, while pursuing my degree in Information Systems, I made the decision to change the course of my career and venture into entrepreneurship due to a tempting opportunity. I developed a liking for business, and for the past 10 years, I have been leading the company's growth, expanding to new locations. In 2023, I received an attractive offer to sell the company, which allowed me to return to my true passion: IT. Now, I am determined to build a successful career in this field.

I'm a data scientist certified by Escola DNC, where I have worked on real cases for various companies, dealing with data manipulation and cleansing, statistics, data analysis, machine learning, business strategies, and recommendation systems. My skill set includes using tools such as CRISP-DM, Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python. I deliver efficient data projects that focus on tangible value for any type of business.
